# Name of Project: Snake Project
# Author: Santigie Sankoh, Abideen Hamisu
# Description: This is a project that looks to focus on students at ALU who are having a lot of work that they canâ€™t handle and this might lead them to have a mental breakdown. So this project is a 2d game that tends to help the ALU students escape from the pressure of the work to maintain their mental health. Since games are important they help people escape the problems of the real world and just have fun when playing the game. That is why games were created.

# OPTION 2(the best option) : We have also included an executable file that will save you with all the hussle. Simple find the Executable folder, exe and then main.exe and run the program. Enjoy!
